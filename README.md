# PizzaRep

## General info
PizzaRep was my playground for Spring Boot and HTML. 	While developing it I've had zero frontend experience and only theoretical knowledge about Spring. Initially it was supposed 
to be a repository (hence the name), but I decided to go for something resembling a shop to work on my web development skills.
In a nutshell it's a website for a restauration.
